        <p>Ukraine, the largest country in Europe by area, is a land of remarkable landscapes, rich culture, and deep history. Known for its golden wheat fields, sunflower expanses, and the winding Dnipro River, Ukraine’s natural beauty is matched by its vibrant cities. Kyiv, the capital, combines ancient cathedrals like St. Sophia with modern architecture, while Lviv offers cobblestone streets and charming baroque buildings. The Carpathian Mountains provide a scenic backdrop in the west, known for outdoor activities and traditional crafts. With a resilient spirit, Ukraine celebrates a unique blend of Eastern European traditions, distinctive folk art, and a deep-rooted heritage.</p>
